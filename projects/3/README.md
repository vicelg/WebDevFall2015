# Web Dev Fall 2015: Project 3

#### Project Description:
Create a landing page for a product. You can choose the product. Try to keep it simple. After choosing a product, the first thing you want to do is wire-frame a basic layout of your landing page. See: [Landing Page Layout Instructions](#landing-page-layout-instructions) for all of the required page elements. After you are satisfied with your layout. Begin to transform your wire-frame into a webpage. See the folder structure in `projects/3/example` and setup your `deliverables` folder the same way. 


##### Landing Page Layout Instructions:
The landing page must include the following elements on it:

1. Page sections:
  * Header
  * Content/Body
    * Cta / Call to action
  * Footer
<div style="height:15px"></div>  
2. Use all of the following tags at least once:
  * `H1` (heading)
  * `H2`
  * `p` (paragraph)
  * `ul` > `li` (unordered list > list item)
<div style="height:15px"></div>  
3. Product description (keep it under a paragraph)
  * Describe the product. Use paragraph tags here and consider using other HTML markup to emphasize text.
    * `b` (bold)
    * `i` (italic)
    * etc... (be creative)
<div style="height:15px"></div>  
4. Bullet point features (3 minimum, 6 maximum)
  * Maybe give each feature an icon. Be creative here.
  * Resources for free icons: [Find Free Icons](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=free+icons)
<div style="height:15px"></div>  
5. Images (at least 2 on the page)
  * The image tag? `<img src="path/to/your/saved/image.ext">`
<div style="height:15px"></div>  
5. Form (this is your CTA, a.k.a. Call to Action)
  * The form must include the following `input` types:
    * `text` First Name
    * `text` Last Name
    * `select` Date of Birth (as a dropdown for: Month / Day / Year)
    * `email` Email Field
    * `radio` Ask a YES/NO question
      * _example_ Are you over 21? (HINT: Use radio buttons (Yes, No))
    * `checkbox` Ask a question with multiple answers.
      * _example_ Pick your 3 fav colors: (HINT: Use checkbox buttons)
